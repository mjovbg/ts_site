While inside venv!
1) Create new django project
    django-admin startproject <name>
    this creates manage.py

2) Create a django app
    python manage.py startapp <name>
    this creates app folder with admin, apps, models, tests, views.py also creates migrations folder.

3) add urls
    in project's utl.py import include --> this will tell django to look in app folder, not project's url
    create urls.py in app's folder
    from django.conf.urls import url
    from . import views --> to import functions you create in views.py

4) settings - register app
    installed_apps list
    add the name of your app
